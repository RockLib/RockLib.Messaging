# How to receive messages

## Starting a receiver

To receive messages, an instance of the `IReceiver` interface is needed. So throughout this section, it is assumed that you have an `IReceiver` variable named `receiver` declared and initialized somewhere. Like this:

```csharp
IReceiver receiver; // TODO: Initialize the receiver variable
```

---

A receiver must be started to begin receiving messages. There are several ways of starting a receiver. One was is to call the `Start` extension method, passing it a callback function to be invoked when a message is received:

```csharp
async Task HandleMessageAsync(IReceiverMessage message)
{
    // TODO: do something with the message
}

receiver.Start(HandleMessageAsync);
```

---

If you need to know which instance of `IReceiver` received the message, pass a callback function with this signature to the `Start` method:

```csharp
async Task HandleMessageAsync(IReceiver receiver, IReceiverMessage message)
{
    // TODO: do something with the receiver and message
}

receiver.Start(HandleMessageAsync);
```

---

If you need to encapsulate the message handler in a class, implement the `IMessageHandler` interface and pass an instance of the object to the `Start` method:

```csharp
class MyMessageHandler : IMessageHandler
{
    public async Task OnMessageReceivedAsync(IReceiver receiver, IReceiverMessage message)
    {
        // TODO: do something with the receiver and message
    }
}

IMessageHandler messageHandler = new MyMessageHandler();
receiver.Start(messageHandler);
```

---

An equivalent way of starting a receiver with an `IMessageHandler` implementation is by setting the `MessageHandler` property:

```csharp
class MyMessageHandler : IMessageHandler
{
    public async Task OnMessageReceivedAsync(IReceiver receiver, IReceiverMessage message)
    {
        // TODO: do something with the receiver and message
    }
}

IMessageHandler messageHandler = new MyMessageHandler();
receiver.MessageHandler = messageHandler;
```

---

## Handling messages

Received messages implement the `IReceiverMessage` interface. The examples in this section assume there is an `IReceiverMessage` parameter named `message`. To access the message payload, use the `StringPayload` or `BinaryPayload` properties:

```csharp
string stringPayload = message.StringPayload;
byte[] binaryPayload = message.BinaryPayload;
```

---

To access the headers of the received message, use the `Headers` property.

```csharp
// The TryGetValue method is generic. Note the out bool parameter.
if (message.Headers.TryGetValue("IsDemoCode", out bool isDemoCode))
{
    // TODO: Do something with the isDemoCode flag.
}

// Note the out int parameter.
if (message.Headers.TryGetValue("CodeSnippetIndex", out int codeSnippetIndex))
{
    // TODO: Do something with codeSnippetIndex.
}

// Note the out string parameter.
if (message.Headers.TryGetValue("ExampleDescription", out string exampleDescription))
{
    // TODO: Do something with exampleDescription.
}

```

---

The `IReceiverMessage` interface provides three methods to signal to the sender of the message what the outcome of processing the message was. If the message *was* processed successfully, and the sender should *not* redeliver it, it should be acknowledged:

```csharp
await message.AcknowledgeAsync();
```

---

If the message was *not* processed successfully, and the sender should *not* redeliver it, the message should be rejected:

```csharp
await message.RejectAsync();
```

---

If the message was *not* processed successfully, and the sender *should* redeliver it, the message should be rolled back:

```csharp
await message.RollbackAsync();
```

---

## Handling Error/Connected/Disconnected Events

Once your instance of IReceiver has been created, you can create handlers for events that the receiver may publish.

---

Connected events can be handled using:

```csharp
receiver.Connected += (obj, args) =>
{
    // Do something when the receiver connects to the service
};
```

---

Error Events can be handled using:

```csharp
receiver.Error += (obj, args) =>
{
    // Do something when the receiver ecounters an error
    throw new Exception($"Error in the receiver: {args.Exception.Message}");
};
```

---

Disconnected Events can be handled using:

```csharp
receiver.Disconnected += (obj, args) =>
{
    // Do something when the receiver disconnects from the service
};
```
