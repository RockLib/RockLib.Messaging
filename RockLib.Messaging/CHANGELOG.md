----

**Note:** Release notes in the above format are not available for earlier versions of
RockLib.Messaging. What follows below are the original release notes.

----

## 2.5.1

Fixes a Resolver bug that leads to infinite recursion if using dependency injection on types that take their own interface in their constructor, like decorators.

## 2.5.0

Adds an overload for the AddSender and AddReceiver extension methods that creates objects capable of reloading themselves when their options change.

## 2.4.4

Adds net5.0 target.

## 2.4.3

Adds icon to project and nuget package.

## 2.4.2

Update dependency packages.

## 2.4.1

Updates to align with Nuget conventions.

## 2.4.0

- Adds `ValidatingSender` decorator and extension methods for DI registration.
- Adds `System.Net.Mime.ContentType` to default allowed header types for sender messages.
- Fixes bug in receiver message headers, where the `DateTimeKind` of the value was not preserved. For example, UTC DateTime strings such as "2020-07-02T22:47:24.4298756Z" would be converted with a `Kind` of `Local`.
- Fixes bug in the `byte[]` constructor of `FakeReceiverMessage`, where the `IsBinaryPayload` header was not being set.

## 2.3.1

A few small improvements:
- Lookup delegates should always be registered as singleton.
- Create messaging scenarios from the registered configuration, instead of from the static `MessagingScenarioFactory` class.

## 2.3.0

Always register a lookup delegate from the `AddSender`, `AddTransactionalSender`, and `AddReceiver` extension methods. The previous version would only register the lookup delegate if all of the messaging services of that type were registered as singleton. Also, for each implementation of lookup delegate, if a transient/scoped service is created but not needed, dispose it.


## 2.2.0

The Add(Receiver|Sender|TransactionalSender) extension methods also register a lookup delegate when lifetime is Singleton. The lookup delegates all have a string parameter and return the messaging scenario with the matching name. Useful when more than one sender/receiver is registered.

## 2.1.0

Adds dependency injection extension methods and builders.

## 2.0.4

Adds support for RockLib_Messaging config section.

## 2.0.3

Adds assembly-level [ConfigSection] attributes.

## 2.0.2

Bug fix: don't remove the message id header when clearing sender message headers.

## 2.0.1

- Obsoletes and hides the synchronous receiver API.
- Embeds the license file in the nuget package.

## 2.0.0

- Changes to `MessagingScenarioFactory`:
  - No longer has a concept of "queue vs topic". The factory methods are `CreateSender` and `CreateReceiver`.
  - Uses `IConfiguration` as its data source instead of `IMessagingScenarioFactory` (which no longer exists).
  - Configurations are assumed to have the subsections, `Senders` and/or `Receivers` (case-insensitive), that respectively contain one or more type-defined implementations of `ISender` and `IReceiver`.
  - Uses `RockLib.Configuration.Config.Root.GetSection("RockLib.Messaging")` as the default value for its configuration.
    - Can call `MessagingScenarioFactory.SetConfiguration` to set the configuration programmatically.
  - Has `CreateSender` and `CreateReceiver` extension methods that work with any instance of `IConfiguration` to create senders and receivers.
  - Adds optional `defaultTypes`, `valueConverters`, `resolver`, and `reloadOnConfigChange` parameters to the create methods, allowing greater customization of the sender or receiver.
- Changes to the sending API:
  - There is no longer an `ISenderMessage` interface, just the concrete `SenderMessage` class.
    - Automatically handles encoding and compression.
    - Replaces the `MessageFormat` property with `IsBinary`.
    - Renames `StringValue` and `BinaryValue` properties to `StringPayload` and `BinaryPayload`.
    - Removes the `Priority` property.
  - The `ISender` interface's `SendAsync` method takes a `CancellationToken` parameter.
- Changes to the receiving API:
  - `IReceiverMessage`
    - The `Acknowledge` method is renamed to `AcknowledgeAsync` and made asynchronous (it returns a `Task`).
    - Adds `RollbackAsync` and `RejectAsync` methods.
      - RollbackAsync allows users to indicate that a message was not successfully processed but should be (or should be allowed to be) redelivered.
      - RejectAsync allows users to indicate that a message could not be successfully processed and should not be redelivered.
      - AcknowledgeAsync allows users to indicate that a message was successfully processed and should not be redelivered.
    - Adds `Handled` property.
      - Returns false for a message that has not yet been handled by the `AcknowledgeAsync`, `RollbackAsync`, or `RejectAsync` methods.
      - Returns true for a message after it has been handled by the `AcknowledgeAsync`, `RollbackAsync`, or `RejectAsync` methods.
    - Replaces `GetStringValue` and `GetBinaryValue` methods with `StringPayload` and `BinaryPayload` properties.
    - Replaces `GetHeaderValue` and `GetHeaderNames` methods with `Headers` property.
    - Removes the `Priority` property.
  - `IReceiver`
    - The `MessageReceived` event and `Start` method are replaced by the read/write `MessageHandler` property of type `IMessageHandler`.
    - The receiver is started when the property is set.
    - The receiver calls the `OnMessageReceivedAsync` method of its `MessageHandler` when a message is received.
    - A receiver can also be started by invoking the `Start` extension method.
      - The delegate parameter passed to the extension method is invoked when the receiver receives a message.
    - Adds an `Error` event for implementations to invoke when an internal error occurs - useful when errors originate in a background thread.
  - `Receiver` base class
    - An abstract class to simplify implementations of the `IReceiver` interface and make them more consistent.
    - Adds validation in the setter of the `MessageHandler` property so the a receiver can only be started once. Also disallows a null value.
  - `ReceiverMessage` base class
    - An abstract class to simplify implementations of the `IReceiverMessage` interface and make them more consistent.
    - Its constructor handles the decoding and decompression of incoming message payloads, whether they be string or binary.
    - Provides an abstract method for implementations to populate its headers.
    - Provides abstract methods for the handler methods: `AcknowledgeAsync`, `RollbackAsync`, and `RejectAsync`.
    - Ensures that the message is only handled once.
- The Named Pipes feature has been moved to its own package, RockLib.Messaging.NamedPipes (it is no longer included in the main RockLib.Messaging package).
- Adds the RockLib.Messaging.SNS package.
  - Adds `SNSSender` class, which allows messages to be sent to an SNS topic.
- Changes to the RockLib.Messaging.SQS package:
  - Renames `SQSQueueSender` and `SQSQueueReceiver` to `SQSSender` and `SQSReceiver`.
  - Adds optional `region` parameter to `SQSSender` and `SQSReceiver`.
  - Adds optional `unpackSNS` flag to `SQSReceiver`.
    - Useful when the SQS queue receives messages from an SNS topic - the payloads of such messages contain a JSON object representing the entire raw SNS message.
    - When set, the JSON object is unpacked, and the body and headers are populated from the unpacked message.
- Adds RockLib.Messaging.Http package.
  - `HttpClientSender`
    - An adapter for the `System.Net.Http.HttpClient` class that implements the `ISender` interface.
    - Allows HTTP messages to be sent using the RockLib.Messaging API.
    - Supports "url tokens", where tokens in the url are replaced with the matching header value of the outgoing sender message.
      - For example, a url value of `http://some-url/api/product/{product_id}` would require messages to have a `product_id` header. If the value of that header was `3`, the actual url that the message is sent to would be `http://some-url/api/product/3`.
  - `HttpListenerReceiver`
    - An adapter for the `System.Net.HttpListener` class that implements the `IReceiver` interface.
    - Allows HTTP messages to be received using the RockLib.Messaging API.
    - Intended for use by non-web (console / background process) applications that need to be accessible via HTTP.
    - Supports "path tokens", where headers are added to incoming messages according to the the tokens in the path.
    - For example, if a receiver had a path value of `/api/product/{product_id}`, all messages it receives will have a header named `product_id`. If a client send the request to `/api/product/4`, the message would contain a `product_id` header with a value of `4`.
- Adds the `ForwardingReceiver` class to the main RockLib.Messaging package.
  - This is a decorator implementation of the `IReceiver` interface that takes three optional `ISender` instances: one for `AcknowledgeAsync`, one for `RollbackAsync`, and one for `RejectAsync`.
  - When a message received by the decorated `IReceiver` is acknowledged (or rolled back / rejected), if the `ForwardingReceiver` is configured with an `AcknowledgeForwarder` (or `RollbackForwarder` / `RejectForwarder`), the message is sent to that `ISender`.
- Adds a `FakeReceiverMessage` class.
  - Allows users to more easily test their application's receiver message handler (without requiring the use of a mocking framework).

## 2.0.0-alpha15

- Removes the defaultSenderType and defaultReceiverType settings from MessagingScenarioFactory.

## 2.0.0-alpha14
